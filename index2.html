<li>Classified ads.
You may want to place an individual classified ad in the paper to sell items such as furniture, jewelry, and electronics. Ads usually aren't too expensive, and you won't have to pay commission when you sell them. Plus, you can price them higher than what you would charge at a garage sale. Craig's List (www.craigslist.com) offers free online classified advertising.
With a little preparation and research, you can make a large profit from spending a small amount of time and money at a self-storage unit auction.

<li>Consignment stores.
This is a great way to make money on larger items, such as furniture, and larger-ticket items, such as jewelry. Like auction houses, the stores take a commission, which may be as much as 50% of the asking price. Things are usually kept for a certain number of days and then they return what does not sell to you.

<li> It's not always about finding treasure.  As long as you can make a profit (and have fun), that's what counts.  If you give up because you aren't making $2000 on your first unit, you often lose out on the $200 and $300 profits along the way.  Money is money, right?
